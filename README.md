RealTime Audio & Text Intelligence is a Python-based project that integrates several natural language processing and speech recognition capabilities into a single Jupyter notebook. It allows users to convert MP3 audio (such as YouTube lectures) to text using Googleâ€™s Speech Recognition API, summarize long passages with transformer models, analyze sentiment, translate English text to Hindi, and answer questions based on a given context using state-of-the-art pre-trained models from Hugging Face. Built with libraries like SpeechRecognition, pydub, and transformers, this toolkit offers a practical end-to-end pipeline for audio and text processing tasks. Ideal for educational, analytical, and assistive applications, this project showcases how speech and text AI can work together in real time.
